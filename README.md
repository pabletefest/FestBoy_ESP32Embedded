# FestBoy_ESP32Embedded
A port of my GB emulator [FestBoy](https://github.com/pabletefest/FestBoy) to a ESP32 microcontroller with TFT Display (ILI9486 driver 8-bit parallel).

This project is intended only for educational porposes and led to my Master's Thesis at Polythecnic University of Valencia (UPV).
